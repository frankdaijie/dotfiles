# My personal configuration

## Shell
I use [oh-my-zsh](https://github.com/robbyrussell/oh-my-zsh) for my zshell
configuration. Besides, I added some personal setting.

## Emacs setting
I use [spacemacs](https://github.com/syl20bnr/spacemacs) personally and my emacs
setting is my supplement to its setting:

- Chinese input method
- Multi-term support for zshell
- Global Yasnippet
